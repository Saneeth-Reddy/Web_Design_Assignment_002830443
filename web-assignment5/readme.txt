I have Developed this website which give comparison of the top model cars used for
 racing.In feature section we can have a detailed features of each and every cars 
 provided so that we can buy the car based on the choice of the person


 
I have used all the scss/sass properties in this websites like,

Flexbox and GridBoxes are used in this website to manage nav bar , images and the comparisons of the cars.



variables - used in the features pages which helps to used the defined 
variables as many time as i want.


custom properties - I have placed all the variables in the 
_(file-Name).scss files and used @import keyword to use the variables from that files.


Nesting - I have used nesting in scss files which helped me 
to place a css for some specific tag without mention of the 
tag with its parent class.


Interpolation - Used this feature to return in the string format of the 
text to a function or a mixin so that i will identify the attribute of the property.


Placeholder Selectors- In about us .html I have used placeholder selector 
which is used to place a piece of attributes in a placeholder indicated by "%" 
and can we called (@extend)  and use the attributes in the place holder how many times we need.


Mixins - used in features.html can be used dynamically change the values of t
he attribuets and perform various styling in each phase of the webpage.


Functions - It is a piece of code which returns some thing when it is called . 
I have used this in the features.html.
